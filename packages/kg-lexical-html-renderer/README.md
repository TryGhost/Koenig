# Koenig Lexical Html Renderer

Renders a lexical editor state string to a HTML string.

This library differs from Lexical's own [lexical-html](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/tree/main/packages/lexical-html) package in a few ways:

1. it's output target is not an editor but rendered web pages or emails which means the handling of nodes (especially custom DecoratorNodes) will differ to the node's built-in editor-focused rendering
2. render output will vary based on supplied options and targets, e.g. when rendering for email the output may use `<table>` elements in place of modern HTML structure
3. it's primary usage environment is server-side

## Install

`npm install @tryghost/kg-lexical-html-renderer --save`

or

`yarn add @tryghost/kg-lexical-html-renderer`


## Usage

Basic usage:

```js
const LexicalHTMLRenderer = require('@tryghost/kg-lexical-html-renderer');
const renderer = new Renderer();

const lexicalState = '{...}';
const html = await renderer.render(lexicalState);
```

Options can be passed in as the second argument to `.render()`.

```js
const html = await renderer.render(lexicalState, {target: 'email'});
```

| Option   | Values |
| -------- | ------ |
| `target` | `'html'` (default), `'email'` |
