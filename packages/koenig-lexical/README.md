# Koenig - Lexical edition

Early stage re-write of Ghost's editor, using Lexical as the editor framework in place of mobiledoc-kit.

## Development

### Pre-requisites

This package makes use of two other built packages in the monorepo, those packages will need to be built before this package's build will succeed.

```
cd packages/kg-default-nodes && yarn build
cd ..
cd packages/kg-clean-basic-html && yarn build
```

_Note:_ If any changes are made to those packages you'll need to rebuild them before the changes will show up in the demo site.

### Running the development version

Run `yarn dev` to start the development server to test/develop the editor standalone. This will generate a demo site from the `index.html` file which renders the demo app in `demo/demo.jsx` and makes it available on http://localhost:5173

### Cards additional setup

#### Gif card

To see this card locally, you need to create `.env.local` file in `koenig-lexical` root package with the next data:
```
VITE_TENOR_API_KEY=xxx
```

How to get the tenor key is described here https://ghost.org/docs/config/#tenor

#### Bookmark & Embed cards

These cards make external web requests. Since the demo doesn't have a server to process these requests, we must fetch these resources on the front end. To do this we need to enable CORS, which is most easily done with a browser extension like 'Test CORS' for Chrome. Otherwise you will see blocked requests logging errors in the console. This can also be avoided by using test data directly without fetching via `fetchEmbed.js`.

### Running inside Admin

To test/develop inside of Admin you can run `yarn preview` then in Ghost set your `editor.url` value in `config.local.json` to `http://127.0.0.1:4173/koenig-lexical.umd.js` and load Admin as usual. With recent updates, if you see a cannot connect error, you may need to use localhost: ``http://localhost:4173/koenig-lexical.umd.js`.

```json
{
    ...
    "editor": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4173/koenig-lexical.umd.js"
    }
}
```

`yarn preview` by itself only serves the library files, it's possible ro run `yarn build --watch` in a separate terminal tab to have auto-rebuild whilst developing.

Note: if you need to run your local packages of `kg-default-nodes` and `kg-lexical-html-renderer`, you will need to run `yarn link` in those repositories and run the output in `ghost/core`. Otherwise `ghost/core` will be using the latest published version listed in `package.json`.

### Project structure

**`/src`**

The main module source. `/src/index.js` is the entry point for the exposed module and should export everything needed to use the module from an external app.

**`/demo`**

Used for developing/demoing the editor. Renders a blank editor with all features enabled.

### Set up details

**CSS**

Styling should be done using Tailwind classes where possible.

All styles are scoped under `.koenig-lexical` class to avoid clashes and keep styling as isolated as possible. PostCSS nesting support is present to make this easier.

- Styles located in `src/styles/` are included in the final built module.
- Styles located in `demo/*.css` are only used in the demo and will not be included in the built module.

When packaging the module, styles are included inside the JS file rather than being separate to allow for a single import of the module in the consuming app.

**SVGs**

SVGs can be imported as React components in the [same way as create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/#adding-svgs). Typically files are stored in `src/assets/`.

All imported files are processed/optimised via SVGO (see `svgo.config.js` for optimisation config) and included in the built JS file.

## Testing

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for unit tests and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for e2e testing.

- `yarn test` runs all tests and exits
- `yarn test:unit` runs unit tests
- `yarn test:unit:watch` runs unit tests and starts a test watcher that re-runs tests on file changes
- `yarn test:e2e` runs e2e tests
- `yarn test:e2e --headed` runs tests in browser so you can watch the tests execute
- `yarn test:slowmo` same as `yarn test:e2e --headed` but adds 100ms delay between instructions to make it easier to see what's happening (note that some tests may fail or timeout due to the added delays)
- `yarn test:e2e --ui` opens a [browser UI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode) in watch mode for exploring and re-running tests
- `yarn test:e2e --ui --headed` same as `yarn test:e2e --ui` but also runs tests in browser so you can watch the tests execute

Before tests are started we build a version of the demo app that is used for the unit tests.

When developing it can be useful to limit unit tests to specific keywords (taken from `describe` or `it/test` names). That's possible using the `-t` param and works with any of the above test commands, e.g.:

- `yarn test:unit:watch -t "buildCardMenu"`

### How to debug e2e tests on CI

You can download the report in case of tests were failed. It can be found in the actions `Summary` in the `Artifacts` section.
To check traces, run command `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip`.
More information about traces can be found here https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer

### ESM in e2e tests

Node enables ECMAScript modules if `type: 'module'` in package.json file. It leads to some restrictions:
- [No require, exports, module.exports, __filename, __dirname](https://github.com/GrosSacASac/node/blob/master/doc/api/esm.md#no-require-exports-moduleexports-__filename-__dirname)
- [Mandatory file extensions](https://github.com/GrosSacASac/node/blob/master/doc/api/esm.md#mandatory-file-extensions)
- [No require.extensions](https://github.com/GrosSacASac/node/blob/master/doc/api/esm.md#no-requireextensions). It means we don't have control over the extensions list. Further will be a description of why this is important.

We can make file extension optional with [--experimental-specifier-resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--experimental-specifier-resolutionmode)
flag, which we use. But node is not recognized `jsx` extension. 
It can be solved with [node loaders](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders-test/tree/main/commonjs-extension-resolution-loader), whereas 
as they're still in [experimental mode](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_experimental_loaders), there is no appropriate 
implementation for this use case.
The same issue was raised in the babel repo, but the loader won't be added while node loaders are 
in [experimental mode](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11934).  

We can add our loader implementation to solve the issue. Still, in reality, we shouldn't need real 
JSX components in e2e tests. It can be a situation when some constants locate in the `jsx` file. In this case, 
we can move them to js file. If it is a problem in the future, we can add our implementation of the loader or 
add an extension to all imports in the project.



### Editor integration

There's a [vitest vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZixuanChen.vitest-explorer) that 
lets you run and debug individual unit tests/groups directly inside vscode.
